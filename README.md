# E-commerce-Back-End

## Description
Hello my name is Matthew Kim and I am a beginner programmer studying at the UCI Coding Bootcamp. The back end for this E-Commerce website was built so that companies can keep track of their products and keep track of data. The program works all inside the terminal and lets the user interact with the data in a way where they can view, add, edit, or delete information stored on the backend. 
Here is a video showing the functionality of the program:

Here is a screenshot of the functioning program through Insomnia.

Thank you for taking the time to view my program!

## Installation
To use the program, you need to install the necessary dependencies. You can either use *npm i* to install from the package.json or use 
*npm init -y* AND 
*npm i dotenv express mysql2 sequelize*

## Usage
To use the program open the file *server.js* in the terminal by using the code *node server.js* to start the program. After this point the server should be running and you are able to check through INSOMNIA.
